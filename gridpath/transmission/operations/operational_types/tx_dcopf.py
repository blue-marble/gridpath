"""
This operational type describes transmission lines whose flows are simulated
using DC optimal power flow (OPF) equations. DC power flow is a linearized
approach to the AC Optimal Power Flow problem, which is a non-linear,
non-convex set of equations describing the energy flow through each
transmission line. The three main assumptions for the DC power flow
approximation are:

 1. line resistances are negligible compared to line reactances, so reactive
    power flows can be neglected;
 2. voltage magnitudes at each bus are kept at their nominal value; and
 3. voltage angle differences across branches are small enough such that the
    sine of the difference can be approximated by the difference, i.e.
    :math:`\sin(\\theta) \\approx \\theta`.

Using these approximations, the power flow problem becomes linear and can be
added to our capacity-expansion / unit commitment model using an additional
set of constraints for flows on each *tx_dcopf* line. The DC OPF constraints
are based on the Kirchhoff approach laid out in "Horsch et al. (2018).
Linear Optimal Power Flow Using Cycle Flows".

.. warning:: Transmission operational types can be optionally be mixed.
    However, if there are any transmission lines that do not have the
    *tx_dcopf* operational types, they will simply not be considered when
    setting up the network constraints laid out in the *tx_dcopf* module, so
    the network flows will be inaccurate.

.. warning:: GridPath uses one user-specified reactance to characterize a
    transmission line and this value doesn't change across time periods, even
    when the planned transmission capacity changes or when the model selects to
    build additional capacity (in the case of new build transmission). If
    this is not a reasonable assumption for the transmission system of
    interest, we recommended not to use the *tx_dcopf* operational type.

    The sum of all potential difference across branches around all cycles
    in the network must be zero in each operational timepoint. In DC power
    flow we assume all voltage magnitudes are kept at nominal value and the
    voltage  angle differences across branches is small enough that we can
    approximate the sinus of the angle with the angle itself, i.e. sin(
    theta) ~ theta. We can therefore write KVL in terms of voltage angles as
    follows:

    ..math:: \\sum_{l} C_{l,c} * \theta_{l} = 0   \\forall c = 1,...,L-N+1

    Using the linearized relationship between voltage angle
    differences across branches and the line flow, :math:`\theta_{l} = x_{l}
    * f_{l}`, we can factor out the voltage angles and write KVL purely in
    terms of line flows and line reactances:

    .. math:: C_{l,c} * x_{l} * f_{l} = 0   \\forall c = 1,...,L-N+1

    The latter equation is enforced in this constraint.

    Note: While most power flow formulations normalize all inputs to per
    unit (p.u.) we can safely avoid that here since the normalization
    factors out in the equation, and it is really just about the relative
    magnitude of the reactance of the lines.
