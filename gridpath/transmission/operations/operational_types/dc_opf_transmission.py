"""
This is a line-level module that adds to the formulation components that
describe the amount of power flowing on each line, subject to DC OPF
constraints. The DC OPF constraints are based on the Kirchhoff approach laid
out in Horsch et al. (2018).

Note: transmission operational types can optionally be mixed and matched.
If there are any non-dc_opf_transmission operational types, they will simply
not be considered when setting up the network constraints laid out in this
module.

        The sum of all potential difference across branches around all cycles
        in the network must be zero. In DC power flow we assume all voltage
        magnitudes are kept at nominal value and the voltage angle differences
        across branches is small enough that we can approximate the sinus of
        the angle with the angle itself, i.e. sin(theta) ~ theta.
        We can therefore write KVL in terms of voltage angles as follows:

        ..math:: \\sum_{l} C_{l,c} * \theta_{l} = 0   \\forall c = 1,...,L-N+1

        Using the linearized relationship between voltage angle
        differences across branches and the line flow, :math:`\theta_{l} = x_{l}
        * f_{l}`, we can factor out the voltage angles and write KVL purely in
        terms of line flows and line reactances:

        .. math:: C_{l,c} * x_{l} * f_{l} = 0   \\forall c = 1,...,L-N+1

        The latter equation is enforced in this constraint.

        Note: While most power flow formulations normalize all inputs to per
        unit (p.u.) we can safely avoid that here since the normalization
        factors out in the equation, and it is really just about the relative
        magnitude of the reactance of the lines.
