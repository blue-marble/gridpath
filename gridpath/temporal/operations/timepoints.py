*Timepoints* are the finest resolution over which operational decisions are
made (e.g. an hour). Generator commitment and dispatch decisions are made for
each timepoint, with some constraints applied across timepoints (e.g. ramp
constraints.) Most commonly, a timepoint is an hour, but the resolution is
flexible: a timepoint could also be a 15-minute, 5-minute, 1-minute, or 4-hour
segment. Different timepoint durations can also be mixed, e.g. some can be
5-minute segments and some can be hours.

Timepoints can also be assigned weights in order to represent other
timepoints that are not modeled explicitly (e.g. use a 24-hour period per month
to represent the whole month using the number of days in that month for the
weight of each of the 24 timepoints). Note that all costs incurred at the
timepoint level are multiplied by the period-level number_years_represented
and discount_factor parameters in the objective function. At the period 
level we use annualized capacity costs (and multiply those by the number of
years in a period), so we must also annualize operational costs incurred at
the timepoint level. In other words, we must use the timepoint weights
(along with the hours-in-timepoint parameter) to calculate the
timepoint-level cost incurred over a year. The sum of
timepoint_weight*hours_in_timepoint over all timepoints in a period must
therefore equal the number of hours in a year (8760, 8766, or 8784). This
will then get multiplied by the number of years in a period and period
discount rate to get the total operational costs.

For example, if you are representing a 10-year period with a single day at a 
24-hour timepoint resolution, the timepoint weight for each of the 24 
timepoints would need to be 365. Timepoint-level costs will be multiplied by 10
automatically to account for the length of the period. If you are 
representing a 1-year period with a single day at a 24-hour resolution, 
the timepoint weight would still be 365, and timepoint-level costs will get
multiplied by 1 automatically to account for the length of the period.
If you are representing a 0.25-year period with a single day at a 24-hour
resolution, the timepoint weight would still be 365.

To support multi-stage production simulation timepoints can also be assigned a
mapping to the previous stage (e.g. timepoints 1-12 in the 5-minute real-time
stage map to timepoint 1 in the hour-ahead stage) and a flag whether the
timepoint is part of a spinup or lookahead segment.

Timepoints that are part of a spinup or lookahead segment are included in the
optimization but are generally discarded when calculating result metrics such
as annual emissions, energy, or cost.

    | a 15-minute timepoint will have 0.25 hours per timepoint whereas a      |

    | used by other modules to track energy (e.g. storage state of charge)    |
    | and when evaluation ramp rates. Timepoints do not need to have the      |
    | same  :code:`hrs_in_tmp` value, i.e. one of them can represent a        |
    | 5-minute segment and another a 24-hour segment.                         |

    | This parameter accounts for the number of other similar 'timepoints'    |
    | that are not explicitly included in the optimization, but that the      |
    | included timepoint represents in the objective function. For example,   |
    | we could include one day from the month to represent the entire month,  |

    | The associated timepoint in the previous stage (if there is any) for    |
    | each timepoint. This is used to pass commitment decisions from one      |
    | stage to the next. E.g. if the real-time stage has 15-minute timepoints |
    | , and the hour-ahead stage had hourly timepoints, all 4 real-time       |
    | timepoints within an hour will point to the same hourly timepoint in    |
    | the previous hour-ahead stage to its commitment decision.               |

    | | :code:`month`                                                         |
