"""
*Timepoints* are the finest resolution over which operational decisions are
made (e.g. an hour). Generator commitment and dispatch decisions are made for
each timepoint, with some constraints applied across timepoints (e.g. ramp
constraints.) Most commonly, a timepoint is an hour, but the resolution is
flexible: a timepoint could also be a 15-minute, 5-minute, 1-minute, or 4-hour
segment. Different timepoint durations can also be mixed, e.g. some can be
5-minute segments and some can be hours.

Timepoints can also be assigned weights in order to represent other
timepoints that are not modeled explicitly (e.g. use a 24-hour period per month
to represent the whole month using the number of days in that month for the
weight of each of the 24 timepoints).

To support multi-stage production simulation timepoints can also be assigned a
mapping to the previous stage (e.g. timepoints 1-12 in the 5-minute real-time
stage map to timepoint 1 in the hour-ahead stage) and a flag whether the
timepoint is part of a spinup or lookahead segment.
Timepoints that are part of a spinup or lookahead segment are included in the
optimization but are generally discarded when calculating result metrics such
as annual emissions, energy, or cost.

    | The number of hours in each timepoint (can be a fraction). For example, |
    | a 15-minute timepoint will have 0.25 hours per timepoint whereas a      |
    | 4-hour timepoint will have 4 hours per timepoint. This parameter is     |
    | used by other modules to track energy (e.g. storage state of charge)    |
    | and when evaluation ramp rates. Timepoints do not need to have the      |
    | same  :code:`hrs_in_tmp` value, i.e. one of them can represent a        |
    | 5-minute segment and another a 24-hour segment.                         |

    | This parameter accounts for the number of other similar 'timepoints'    |
    | that are not explicitly included in the optimization, but that the      |
    | included timepoint represents in the objective function. For example,   |
    | we could include one day from the month to represent the entire month,  |
    | in which case the timepoint_weight for each timepoint on that day will  |
    | be the number of the days in the respective month.                      |

    | The associated timepoint in the previous stage (if there is any) for    |
    | each timepoint. This is used to pass commitment decisions from one      |
    | stage to the next. E.g. if the real-time stage has 15-minute timepoints |
    | , and the hour-ahead stage had hourly timepoints, all 4 real-time       |
    | timepoints within an hour will point to the same hourly timepoint in    |
    | the previous hour-ahead stage to its commitment decision.               |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | | :code:`month`                                                         |
    | | *Defined over*: :code:`TMPS`                                          |
    | | *Within*: :code:`MONTHS`                                              |

    | The month that each timepoint belongs to. This is used to determine     |
    | fuel costs during that timepoint, among others.                         |
