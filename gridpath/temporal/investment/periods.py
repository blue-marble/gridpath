    The module adds the *PERIODS* set to the model formulation.

    Periods must be non-negative integers and the set is ordered.

    We will designate the *PERIODS* set with :math:`P` and the timepoints
    index will be :math:`p`.

    Each period is associated with a *discount_factor* parameter and a
    *number_years_represented* parameter.

    The *discount_factor* parameter determines the relative objective
    function weight of investment and operational decisions made in each
    period (i.e. future costs can be weighted less).

    The *number_years_represented* parameter accounts for the number of
    years that the periods is meant to represent. Investment cost inputs in
    GridPath are annualized, so they are multiplied by this parameter in the
    objective function.

    This module organizes timepoints into periods. Each timepoint is
    assigned a *period* parameter where :math:`period_t\in H`, i.e. each
    timepoint occurs within a specific period.

    We also derive the following set and parameters:

    We use :math:`period_t` to create the indexed set
    *TIMEPOINTS_IN_PERIOD* (:math:`\{T_p\}_{p\in P}`; :math:`T_p\subset T`)
    that allows us to determine the subsets of timepoints :math:`T_p` that
    occur in each period :math:`p`.

    Finally, we determine which period is the first period
    (:math:`first\_period\in P`), which periods are in the set
    NOT_FIRST_PERIODS, i.e. the period(s) (if any) that is/are not the first
    (:math:`N\_F\_P\subset P`), and which is the previous period for each
    period (:math:`previous\_period_{n\_f\_p}\in P`).
