Each *timepoint* in a GridPath model also belongs to a *period* (e.g. a year),
which describes when decisions to build or retire infrastructure are made. A
*period* must be specified in both capacity-expansion and production-cost
models. In a production-cost simulation context, we can use the period to
exogenously change the amount of available capacity, but the *period*
temporal unit is mostly used in the capacity-expansion approach, as it
defines when capacity decisions are made and new infrastructure becomes
available (or is retired). That information in turn feeds into the horizon-
and timepoint-level operational constraints, i.e. once a generator is build,
the optimization is allowed to operate it in subsequent periods (usually for
the duration of the generators's lifetime).
You must specify *period* duration via the *period_start_year* and
*period_end_year* parameters (the duration is calculated within GridPath
based on those values). Note that the start year is inclusive and the end year
is exclusive. Capacity can either exist or not for the entire duration of a
period. A discount factor can also be applied to weight costs differently
depending on when (in which period) they are incurred.

.. warning:: Support for investment periods that are shorter than 1 year,
    e.g. monthly investment decisions, is largely untested, so be extra careful
    if attempting to use this functionality.
