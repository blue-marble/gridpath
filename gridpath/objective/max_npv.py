"""
GridPath's objective function consists of modularized components. This
modularity allows for different objective functions to be defined. Here, we
discuss the objective of maximizing the net present value of revenues minus
costs.

Its most basic version includes the aggregated project capacity costs and
aggregated project operational costs, and any load-balance penalties
incurred (i.e. the aggregated unserved energy and/or overgeneration costs).

Other standard objective function components include:

    * aggregated transmission line capacity investment costs
    * aggregated transmission operational costs (hurdle rates)
    * aggregated reserve violation penalties

GridPath also can include custom objective function components that may not
be standard for all systems. Examples currently include:

    * local capacity shortage penalties
    * planning reserve margin costs
    * various tuning costs

Market costs and revenues may also be included.

GridPath can include costs on carbon emissions, so certain formulations can
interpreted as minimizing emissions.

All revenue and costs are in net present value terms, with a user-specified
discount factor applied depending on the period.
