"""
GridPath's objective function consists of modularized components. This
modularity allows for different objective functions to be defined. Here, we
discuss the objective of minimizing total system costs.

Its most basic version includes the aggregated project capacity costs and
aggregated project operational costs, and any load-balance penalties
incurred (i.e. the aggregated unserved energy and/or overgeneration costs).

Other standard objective function components include:

    * aggregated transmission line capacity investment costs
    * aggregated transmission operational costs (hurdle rates)
    * aggregated reserve violation penalties

GridPath also can include custom objective function components that may not
be standard for all systems. Examples currently include:

    * local capacity shortage penalties
    * planning reserve margin costs
    * various tuning costs

All costs are net present value costs, with a user-specified discount factor
applied to call costs depending on the period in which they are incurred.
