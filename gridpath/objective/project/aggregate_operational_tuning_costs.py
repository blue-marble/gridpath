Tuning costs to prevent undesirable behavior when problem is degenerate.
E.g. since the cost incurred by hydro over the course of a horizon is the same 
regardless of exact dispatch, cases may arise when the project is ramped 
unnecessarily unless there's a cost on the ramp. This aggregates the tuning 
costs imposed on hydro to prevent this behavior.
