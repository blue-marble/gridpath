This module adds load-balance penalty costs to the objective function.
Penalties can be applied on unserved energy, overgeneration, and the maximum
unserved load experienced in the study period (the latter is only indexed by
load zone and is not weighted by any timepoint- or period-level parameters).

.. note:: Unserved_Energy_MW, unserved_energy_penalty_per_mwh,
    Overgeneration_MW, overgeneration_penalty_per_mw, and
    max_unserved_load_penalty_per_mw are declared in
    system/load_balance/load_balance.py
