    This method populates the following 'dynamic components':

    * required_reserve_modules
    * headroom_variables or footroom_variables
    * reserve_variable_derate_params
    * reserve_to_energy_adjustment_params

    The *required_reserve_modules* list will be populated based on the
    user-requested features, as the reserve modules will only call this
    method if they are included in a requested feature.

    The *headroom_variables* and *footroom_variables* components are populated
    based on the data in the *projects.tab* input file.

    When this method is called, the module calling it will specify whether
    the respective reserve variable name should be added to the headroom or
    footroom dictionaries. The reserve module will also specify what the
    name is of the column in projects.tab where the project's balancing area
    for the respective reserve is specified, the *ba_column_name*. For
    projects for which a balancing area is specified (as opposed to having a
    '.' value indicating no balancing area), the respective
    reserve-provision variable name (the *reserve_provision_variable_name*
    specified by the reserve module calling this method) will be added to
    the project's list of headroom/footroom variables. These lists will then be
    passed to the 'add_module_specific_components' method of the
    operational-modules and used to build the appropriate operational
    constraints for each project, usually named the 'max power rule' (power +
    upward reserves must be less than or equal to online capacity) and 'min
    power rule' (power - downward reserves must be greater than or equal to
    the minimum stable level) in the operational-type modules.

    Advanced GridPath functionality includes the ability to put a more
    stringent constraint on reserve-provision than the available
    headroom/footroom by de-rating how much of the available project
    headroom/footroom can be used for a certain reserve-type in the respective
    constraints in the *operational_type* modules. The
    *reserve_variable_derate_params* dynamic component dictionary is
    populated here; it has the project-level reserve provision variable as
    key and the derate param for the respective reserve variable as value.

    .. note:: Currently, these de-rates are only used in the *variable*
        operational type and we need to add them to other operational types.

    Advancec GridPath functionality also includes the ability to account for
    the energy effects of reserve-provision. For example, when providing
    regulation-up during a timepoint, projects will occasionally be called
    upon, so they will produce extra energy above what was schedule for the
    timepont. Similarly, if they are providing load-following down,
    they will occasionally be called upon to reduce their output, so will
    produce less energy than 'scheduled' for the timepoint. To account for
    this, the simplest treatment is to multiply the reserve-provision
    variables by a parameter and include that 'energy' in other constraints.
    We create a dictionary of the reserve-provision variables and the
    adjustment parameter name for each reserve-type requested by the user.

    .. note:: Currently, these adjustments are only used in the *variable*
        operational type and we need to add them to other operational types.
