"""
This module describes the operations of 'continuous-commit' generators,
i.e. generators with on/off commitment decisions, but with the binary
commitment decision relaxed. The relaxation replaces the binary variables
(commit, start, stop) with continuous variables within the range [0,1].

Except for this relaxation, the formulation is exactly the same as
*dispatchable_binary_commit*, which is based on
"Tight and compact MILP formulation for the thermal unit commitment problem"
(Morales-Espana et al. 2013), available online at
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6485014

    :param m: the Pyomo abstract model object we are adding components to

    First, we determine the project subset with 'dispatchable_continuous_commit'
    as operational type. This is the *DISPATCHABLE_CONTINUOUS_COMMIT_GENERATORS*
    set, which we also designate with :math:`CCG\subset R` and index
    :math:`ccg`.

    We define several operational parameters over :math:`CCG`: \n
    *dispcontcommit_min_stable_level_fraction* \ :sub:`ccg`\ -- the
    minimum stable level of the dispatchable-continuous-commit generator,
    defined as a fraction its capacity \n
    *dispcontcommit_startup_plus_ramp_up_rate* \ :sub:`ccg`\ -- the project's
    upward ramp rate limit during startup, defined as a fraction of its capacity
    per minute. This param, adjusted for timepoint duration, has to be equal or
    larger than *dispcontcommit_min_stable_level_fraction* for the unit to be
    able to start up between timepoints. \n
    *dispcontcommit_shutdown_plus_ramp_down_rate* \ :sub:`ccg`\ -- the project's
    downward ramp rate limit during shutdown, defined as a fraction of its
    capacity per minute. This param, adjusted for timepoint duration, has to be
    equal or larger than *dispcontcommit_min_stable_level_fraction* for the
    unit to be able to shut down between timepoints. \n
    *dispcontcommit_ramp_up_when_on_rate* \ :sub:`ccg`\ -- the project's
    upward ramp rate limit during operations, defined as a fraction of its
    capacity per minute. \n
    *dispcontcommit_ramp_down_when_on_rate* \ :sub:`ccg`\ -- the project's
    downward ramp rate limit during operations, defined as a fraction of its
    capacity per minute. \n

    *DISPATCHABLE_CONTINUOUS_COMMIT_GENERATOR_OPERATIONAL_TIMEPOINTS* (
    :math:`CCG\_OT\subset RT`) is a two-dimensional set that
    defines all project-timepoint combinations when a
    'dispatchable_continuous_commit' project can be operational.


    There are three relaxed binary decision variables, and one continuous
    decision variable, all defined over
    *DISPATCHABLE_CONTINUOUS_COMMIT_GENERATOR_OPERATIONAL_TIMEPOINTS*.
    Commit_Continuous is the relaxed binary commit variable to represent 'on' or
    'off' state of a generator.
    Start_Continuous is the relaxed binary variable to represent the state when a
    generator is turning on.
    Stop_Continuous is the relaxed binary variable to represent the state when a
    generator is shutting down.
    Provide_Power_Above_Pmin_DispContinuousCommit_MW is the power provision
    variable for the generator.

    The main constraints on dispatchable-continuous-commit generator power
    provision are as follows:
    For :math:`(ccg, tmp) \in CCG\_OT`: \n
    :math:`Provide\_Power\_DispContinuousCommit\_MW_{ccg, tmp} \geq
    Commit\_MW_{ccg, tmp} \\times disp\_continuous\_commit\_min\_stable\_level
    \_fraction \\times Capacity\_MW_{ccg,p}` \n
    :math:`Provide\_Power\_DispContinuousCommit\_MW_{ccg, tmp} \leq
    Commit\_MW_{ccg, tmp} \\times Capacity\_MW_{ccg,p}`

        Power provision adjusted for upward reserves can't exceed generator's
        maximum power output. If the unit is starting up this timepoint or
        shutting down the next timepoint, tighten the constraint to account for
        startup or shutdown ramp limits

        This constraint is a tighter, more compact formulation of the previous
        two maximum power constraints, combining the tightening for startup
        and shutdown ramping into one constraint. Combining the tightening for
        startup and shutdown ramp is only valid if only one tightening can be
        active at a time (if they are both active, you can get a negative
        RHS which would make the constraint infeasible).
        This is only the case if the mininum up-time disallows a unit from
        starting in one timepoint (which would activate the startup ramp
        tightening) and shutting down the next timepoint (which would activate
        the shutdown ramp tightening). Therefore, this constraint only applies
        when *min_up_time* is larger than the *number_of_hours_in_timepoint*.
        Conversely, if the minimum up-time is small enough that units can run
        for only one timepoint (start up one timepoint, shut down the next),
        this constraint should be skipped and the two other maximum power
        constraints that break out the tightening into two different constraints
        should be applied instead.

        We assume that a unit has to reach its setpoint at the start of the
        timepoint; Therefore, if a unit is shutting down in the next timepoint
        (binary stop variable equal to 1), the ramping is assumed to take place
        during the current timepoint, and we use the shut down ramp rate that
        is adjusted for the current timepoint duration. Similarly, if a unit is
        starting up in the current timepoint (binary start variable equal to 1),
        the ramping is assumed to take place during the previous timepoint, and
        we use the start up ramp rate that is adjusted for the previous
        timepoint duration.
