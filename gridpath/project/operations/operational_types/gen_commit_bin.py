"""
This operational types describes generation projects that can be turned on and
off, i.e. that have binary commitment variables associated with them. This is
particularly useful for production cost modeling approaches where capturing
the unit commitment decisions is important, e.g. when modeling a slow-starting
coal plant. This operational type is not compatible with new-build capacity
types (e.g. gen_new_lin) where the available capacity is an endogenous decision
variable.

The optimization makes commitment and power output decisions in every
timepoint. If the project is not committed (or starting up / shutting down),
power output is zero. If it is committed, power output can vary between a
pre-specified minimum stable level (greater than zero) and the project's
available capacity. Heat rate degradation below full load is considered.
These projects can be allowed to provide upward and/or downward reserves.

Startup and/or shutdown trajectories can be optionally modeled by specifying a
low startup and/or shutdown ramp rate.  Ramp rate limits as well us minimum up
and down time constraints are implemented. Starts and stops -- and the
associated cost and emissions -- can be tracked and constrained.

Costs for this operational type include fuel costs, variable O&M costs, and
startup and shutdown costs.

Interesting background papers:
- "Hidden power system inflexibilities imposed by traditional unit commitment
formulations", Morales-Espana et al. (2017).
- "Tight and compact MILP formulation for the thermal unit commitment problem",
Morales-Espana et al. (2013).
