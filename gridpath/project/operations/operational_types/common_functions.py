    :return: the relevant timepoints to look at for the minimum up/down time
        constraints

    We need to figure out how far back we need to look,
    i.e. which timepoints we need to consider when capacity could have
    been turned on/off that must still be on/off in the current timepoint *t*.

    Any capacity that was turned on/off between t and t-1 must still be
    on/off in t, so timepoint *t* is a relevant timepoint.

    Capacity must also still be on/off if it was turned on/off less than its
    up/down time ago, i.e. if it was turned on/off between timepoints that
    are within the min up/down time from the beginning of the current
    timepoint. Once we reach a timepoint whose duration takes us to a
    point in time that is removed from the beginning of timepoint *t* by a
    time greater than or equal to the min_time, that timepoint is not
    relevant anymore and we have completed our list of relevant timepoints.

    In a simple case, let's assume all timepoints have durations of 1 hour.
    Timepoint t-1 is removed from the start of timepoint *t* by an hour,
    timepoint t-2 by 2 hours, timepoint t-3 by 3 hours, etc. Therefore, if
    if a generator has a 4-hour minimum up time and was started up in t-3 (
    i.e. between t-4 and t-3), then it must still be on in the current
    timepoint. If it was started up in t-4, it has already been up for 4
    hours by the time timepoint *t* begins, so it can be turned off. The
    relevant timepoints are therefore t-1, t-2, and t-3; we do not need to
    constrain capacity turned on/off in t-4 or farther in the past.

    If t-2 has duration of 2-hours, on the other hand, the total duration of
    the previous three timepoints would be 4 hours and the generator turned
    on in t-3 should therefore be allowed to turn off in the current
    timepoint *t*. In this case, the relevant timepoints would be t-1 and
    t-2. By the time we reach t-3, we will have reached the 4-hour minimum
    up/down time, so t-3 will not be relevant for the minimum up time
    constraint in timepoint *t*.
