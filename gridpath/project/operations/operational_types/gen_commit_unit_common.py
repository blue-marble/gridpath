This operational types describes generation projects that can be turned on and
off, i.e. that have binary commitment variables associated with them. This is
particularly useful for production cost modeling approaches where capturing
the unit commitment decisions is important, e.g. when modeling a slow-starting
coal plant. This operational type is not compatible with new-build capacity
types (e.g. gen_new_lin) where the available capacity is an endogenous decision
variable.

The optimization makes commitment and power output decisions in every
timepoint. If the project is not committed (or starting up / shutting down),
power output is zero. If it is committed, power output can vary between a
pre-specified minimum stable level (greater than zero) and the project's
available capacity. Heat rate degradation below full load is considered.
These projects can be allowed to provide upward and/or downward reserves.

Startup and/or shutdown trajectories can be optionally modeled by specifying a
low startup and/or shutdown ramp rate.  Ramp rate limits as well us minimum up
and down time constraints are implemented. Starts and stops -- and the
associated cost and emissions -- can be tracked and constrained.

Costs for this operational type include fuel costs, variable O&M costs, and
startup and shutdown costs.

formulations", Morales-Espana et al. (2017).
- "Tight and compact MILP formulation for the thermal unit commitment problem",

    | The project's minimum down time cutoff to activate a given startup      |
    | type. If the unit has been down for more hours than this cutoff, the    |
    | relevant startup type will be activated. E.g. if a unit has 2 startup   |
    | types (hot and cold) with respective cutoffs of 4 hours and 8 hours, it |
    | means that startup type 1 (the hot start) will be activated if the unit |
    | starts after a down time between 4-8 hours, and startup type 2 (the     |
    | cold start) will be activated if the unit starts after a down time of   |
    | over 8 hours. The cutoff for the hottest start must match the unit's    |
    | minimum down time. If the unit is fast-start without a minimum down     |
    | time, the user should input zero (rather than NULL)                     |

    | The project's availability threshold below which it cannot be           |
    | committed/synced. Defaults to 0.01, i.e., the commit and sync variables |
    | will be set to zero any time availability is 0.01 or less (for          |
    | gen_commit_bin; the gen_commit_lin variables are still continuous), but |
    | can be 1 otherwise. Make sure to set this to a positive fraction to     |
    | ensure you approximate partial availability but avoid the issue where   |
    | the optimization can set the sync variables to 1 even when the project  |
    | is unavailable, thus avoiding startup costs.                            |

        **Constraint Name**: GenCommitBin_No_Sync_When_Unavailable_Constraint
        **Enforced Over**: GEN_COMMIT_BIN_OPR_TMPS

        A unit cannot be synced when (fully-ish) unavailable. When the
        availability derate is < a user-specified number (defaults to 0.01),
        this will force commitment, power, and startup/shutdown
        power to 0 for gen_commit_bin.

        This constraint is needed to prevent the model from committing a
        unit while unavailable, thus avoiding startup costs when the unit
        comes back from unavailability, as startup costs are based on
        available capacity started up.

        If Availability_Derate is 1, GenCommitB/Lin_Synced can be set to 1.
        If Availability_Derate is 0, GenCommitB/Lin_Synced must be set to 0.
        If Availability_Derate >= partial_availability_threshold,
        GenCommitBin_Synced can be set to 1.
        If Availability_Derate < partial_availability_threshold,
        GenCommitBin_Synced must be set to 0.

        Pyomo disallows strict inequalities, so 1% is set as default as it is
        unlikely to have availabilities lower than this and the number is scaled

        When units are started, they have to stay on for a minimum number
        of hours described by the gen_commit_bin_min_up_time_hours parameter.
        The constraint is enforced by ensuring that the binary commitment
        is at least as large as the number of unit starts within min up time
        hours.

        We ensure a unit turned on less than the minimum up time ago is
        still on in the current timepoint *tmp* by checking how much units
        were turned on in each 'relevant' timepoint (i.e. a timepoint that
        begins more than or equal to gen_commit_bin_min_up_time_hours ago
        relative to the start of timepoint *tmp*) and then summing those
        starts.

        If using linear horizon boundaries, the constraint is skipped for all
        timepoints less than min up time hours from the start of the
        timepoint's horizon because the constraint for the first included
        timepoint will sufficiently constrain the binary start variables of

        Startup_type s can only be activated (startup_type >= 1) if the unit
        has previously been down within the appropriate interval. The
        interval for startup type s is defined by the user specified
        boundary parameters gen_commit_bin_down_time_cutoff_hours[s] and
        gen_commit_bin_down_time_cutoff_hours[s+1]. Note that the down time
        interval includes any timepoints during which the unit is starting up.

        For the coldest (last) startup type, there is no s+1 and the
        constraint is skipped. This is okay because the model will select a
        hotter, cheaper startup type if it can and there can only be one
        startup_type active at once (see unique_startup_type_constraint_rule).
        This also means the constraint will be skipped if there is only one
        startup type.

        The constraint works by first determining the relevant timepoints, i.e.
        the timepoints within [TSU,s ; TSU,s+1) hours from *tmp*. If the unit
        has been down in any of these timepoints, we can activate the startup
        variable of the associated startup type for timepoint *tmp* (but only
        if the unit is actually starting in timepoint *tmp*).

        Example: we are in timepoint 7 (hourly resolution) and the down time
        interval is 2-4 hours for a hot start and >=4 hours for a cold start.
        This means timepoints 4 and 5 will be the relevant timepoints (resp. 2
        and 3 hours from *tmp*). A shutdown in any of those timepoints means
        that a start in timepoint 7 would be a hot start.

        Power provision in the start timepoint (i.e. the timepoint when the unit
        is first committed) is constrained by the startup ramp rate (adjusted

        In other words, to provide 'committed' power in the start timepoint, we

        by the capacity, which may not bind. To elaborate, when we are not in a
        start timepoint, t-1 could have had:
        1) the unit committed, meaning Pstarting[t-1]=0, resulting in
        power provision <= capacity, or
