"""
This module describes the operations of dispatchable generators with 'capacity
commitment,' i.e. commit some level of capacity below the total capacity.
This approach can be good for modeling 'fleets' of generators, e.g. a total
2000 MW of 500-MW units, so if 2000 MW are committed 4 generators (x 500 MW)
are committed. Integer commitment is not enforced; capacity commitment with
this approach is continuous.

    Here, we define the set of dispatchable-capacity-commit generators:
    *DISPATCHABLE_CAPACITY_COMMIT_GENERATORS*
    (:math:`CCG`, index :math:`ccg`) and use this set to get the subset of
    *PROJECT_OPERATIONAL_TIMEPOINTS* with :math:`g \in CCG` -- the
    *DISPATCHABLE_CAPACITY_COMMIT_GENERATOR_OPERATIONAL_TIMEPOINTS* (
    :math:`CCG\_OT`).

    We define several operational parameters over :math:`CCG`: \n
    *disp_cap_commit_min_stable_level_fraction* \ :sub:`ccg`\ -- the minimum
    stable level of the project, defined as a fraction of its
    capacity \n
    *unit_size_mw* \ :sub:`ccg`\ -- the unit size for the
    project, which is needed to calculate fuel burn if the project
    represents a fleet \n
    *dispcapcommit_startup_plus_ramp_up_rate* \ :sub:`ccg`\ -- the project's
    upward ramp rate limit during startup, defined as a fraction of its capacity
    per minute. This param, adjusted for timepoint duration, has to be equal or
    larger than *disp_cap_commit_min_stable_level_fraction* for the unit to be
    able to start up between timepoints. \n
    *dispcapcommit_shutdown_plus_ramp_down_rate* \ :sub:`ccg`\ -- the project's

    equal or larger than *disp_cap_commit_min_stable_level_fraction* for the
    unit to be able to shut down between timepoints. \n

    The power provision variable for dispatchable-capacity-commit generators,
    *Provide_Power_DispCapacityCommit_MW*, is defined over

    Commit_Capacity_MW is the continuous variable to represent commitment
    state of a project. It is also defined over over

        allowed is if they all stayed online. Startups are treated separately.
