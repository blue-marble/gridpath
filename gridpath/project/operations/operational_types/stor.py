"""
This operational type describes a generic storage resource. It can be
applied to a battery, to a pumped-hydro project or another storage
technology.

The type is associated with three main variables in each timepoint when the
project is available: the charging level, the discharging level, and the
energy available in storage. The first two are constrained to be less than
or equal to the project's power capacity. The third is constrained to be
less than or equal to the project's energy capacity. The model tracks the
stage of charge in each timepoint based on the charging and discharging
decisions in the previous timepoint, with adjustments for charging and
discharging efficiencies. Storage projects can be allowed to provide upward
and/or downward reserves.

Costs for this operational type include variable O&M costs.
