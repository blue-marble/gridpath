This module describes the operations of generation projects with 'capacity
commitment' operational decisions, i.e. continuous variables to commit some
level of capacity below the total capacity of the project. This operational
type is particularly well suited for application to 'fleets' of generators
with the same characteristics. For example, we could have a GridPath project
with a total capacity of 2000 MW, which actually consists of four 500-MW
units. The optimization decides how much total capacity to commit (i.e. turn
on), e.g. if 2000 MW are committed, then four generators (x 500 MW) are on
and if 500 MW are committed, then one generator is on, etc.

The capacity commitment decision variables are continuous. This approach
makes it possible to reduce problem size by grouping similar generators
together and linearizing the commitment decisions.

The optimization makes the capacity-commitment and dispatch decisions in
every timepoint. Project power output can vary between a minimum loading level
(specified as a fraction of committed capacity) and the committed capacity
in each timepoint when the project is available. Heat rate degradation below
full load is considered. These projects can be allowed to provide upward
and/or downward reserves.

No standard approach exists for applying ramp rate and minimum up and down
time constraints to this operational type. GridPath does include
experimental functionality for doing so. Starts and stops -- and the
associated cost and emissions -- can also be tracked and constrained for
this operational type.

Costs for this operational type include fuel costs, variable O&M costs, and
startup and shutdown costs.

    pre-specified ramp rate fraction. The max on to on ramp up
    allowed is if they all stayed online. Startups are treated separately.
    There are limitations to this approach. For example, if online
    capacity was producing at full power at t-2 and t-1, some additional
    capacity was turned on at t-1 and ramped to some level above its
    Pmin but not full output, this constraint would allow for the total

    is already producing at full power. In reality, this situation is
