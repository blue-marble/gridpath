"""
The **gridpath.project.operations** package contains modules to describe the
operational capabilities, constraints, and costs of generation, storage,
and demand-side infrastructure 'projects' in the optimization problem.

In this package, we also create the project fuel burn and cost components to
be passed downstream for aggregation into the system-level constraints and
the objective function.

In the `__init__` module of the package, we specify fuel burn and cost
parameters for each project. The project's operational type uses these
parameters to determine the projects will incur fuel burn and cost in each
operational timepoint. All parameters are optional, i.e. each type can be
used without fuel or variable cost for example. Conversely, the user needs
to ensure that the specified functionality makes sense for the project's
operational type, e.g. even if startup costs are specified for a gen_var
project, that operational type uses the default method for startup costs,
which returns 0, as variable generators do not have the concept of startup
(see the documentation in operational_types.__init__ for the defaults and in
each individual operational type module). When incompatible parameters are
specified for an operational type, GridPath will flag a validation error and
throw a warning (but not an error) at runtime.
