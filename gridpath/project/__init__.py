    This method adds several project-related 'dynamic components' to the
    Python class object (created in *gridpath.auxiliary.dynamic_components*) we
    use to pass around components that depend on the selected modules and
    the scenario input data.

    First, we get the unique sets of project 'capacity types' and 'operational
    types.' We will use this lists to iterate over the required capacity-type
    and operational-type modules, so that they can add the relevant params,
    sets, variables, etc. to the model, load their data, export their
    results, etc.

    We will also set the keys for the headroom and footroom variable
    dictionaries: the keys are all the projects included in the
    'projects.tab' input file. The values of these dictionaries are
    initially empty lists and will be populated later by each of included
    the reserve (e.g regulation up) modules. E.g. if the user has requested to
    model spinning reserves and project *r* has a value in the column
    associated with the spinning-reserves balancing area, then the name of
    project-level spinning-reserves-provision variable will be added to that
    project's list of variables in the 'headroom_variables' dictionary. For
    downward reserves, the associated variables are added to the
    'footroom_variables' dictionary.

    Here, we describe all projects to be included in the optimization,
    what load zone they are located in, and their 'types,' both their
    'capacity type' and their 'operational type.' We will designate the
    *PROJECTS* set with :math:`R` and the projects index will be :math:`r`.

    The project load zone parameter (:math:`load\_zone_r\in Z`) determines
    which load zone's load-balance constraint the project contributes to.

    The operational type of a project is given by the
    *operational_type*\ :sub:`r`\  param and determines things like whether the
    project is a fuel-based dispatchable generator (e.g. a CCGT) or a
    baseload project (e.g. nuclear), is it an intermittent plant, is it a
    storage project, etc. The available 'operational types' are implemented
    in distinct modules and are described below. Each project must have an
    *operational_type*.

    The module also adds a parameter for variable O&M cost per MWh of energy
    production for all projects: *variable_om_cost_per_mwh*\ :sub:`r`\.
