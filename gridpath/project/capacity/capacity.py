"""
This is a project-level module that adds to the formulation components that
describe the capacity of projects that are available to the optimization for
each period. For example, the capacity can be a fixed number or an
expression with variables depending on the project's *capacity_type*. The
project capacity can then be used to constrain operations, contribute to
reliability constraints, etc.

.. note:: We will be renaming the *capacity_type* modules to a more
    intuitive convention than currently used.

    """
    :param m: the Pyomo abstract model object we are adding components to
    :param d: the DynamicComponents class object we will get components from;
        here we need the list of capacity types as well as the
        *capacity_type_operational_period_sets* list of sets after it has
        been populate by the capacity-type modules

    First, we iterate over all required *capacity_types* modules (this is the
    set of distinct project capacity types in the list of projects specified
    by the user) and add the components specific to the respective
    *capacity_type* module. We do this by calling the
    *add_module_specific_components* method of the capacity_type module if
    the method exists.

    The capacity_type modules will also add to the dynamic component class
    object's *capacity_type_operational_period_sets* attribute -- the list
    of sets we will then to get join to get the final
    *PROJECT_OPERATIONAL_PERIODS* set over which we'll define project capacity.

    The *PROJECT_OPERATIONAL_PERIODS* set is a two-dimensional set that
    defines all project-period combinations when a project can be operational
    (i.e. either has specified capacity or can be build). We designate the
    *PROJECT_OPERATIONAL_PERIODS* set with :math:`RP` and the index will be
    :math:`r,p`. This set is created by joining sets added by the
    *capacity_type* modules, as how operational periods are determined
    differs by capacity type.

    The Pyomo expression *Capacity_MW*\ :sub:`r,p`\  defines the project
    capacity in each period (in which the project can exist) in the model.
    The exact formulation of the expression depends on the project's
    *capacity_type*. For each project, we call its *capacity_type* module's
    *capacity_rule* method in order to formulate the expression. E.g. a
    project of the  *existing_gen_no_economic_retirement* capacity_type will
    have a pre-specified capacity whereas a project of the
    *new_build_generator* capacity_type will have a model variable (or sum of
    variables) as its *Capacity_MW*\ :sub:`r,p`\. This expression will then
    be used by other modules.

    Storage capacity_type modules will also add to the dynamic component class
    object's *storage_only_capacity_type_operational_period_sets* attribute
    -- the list of sets we will then to get join to get the final
    *STORAGE_OPERATIONAL_PERIODS* set over which we'll define project capacity.

    The *STORAGE_OPERATIONAL_PERIODS* set is a two-dimensional set that
    defines all project-period combinations when a storage project can exist (
    i.e. either has specified capacity or can be build). We designate the
    *STORAGE_OPERATIONAL_PERIODS* set with :math:`SP` and the index will be
    :math:`s,p`. *SP* is a subset of *RP*.

    The Pyomo expression *Energy_Capacity_MWh*\ :sub:`s,p`\  defines the
    storage project's energy capacity in each period (in which the project can
    exist) in the model. The exact formulation of the expression depends on
    the project's capacity_type. For each project, we call its capacity_type
    module's *energy_capacity_rule* method in order to formulate the
    expression.

    Finally, we derive three more sets for later usage:
    *OPERATIONAL_PERIODS_BY_PROJECT*, *PROJECT_OPERATIONAL_TIMEPOINTS*,
    and *OPERATIONAL_PROJECTS_IN_TIMEPOINT*.

    *OPERATIONAL_PERIODS_BY_PROJECT* (:math:`\{OP_r\}_{r\in R}`;
    :math:`OP_r\subset P`) is an indexed set of the operational periods
    :math:`p\in P` for each project :math:`r\in R`.

    *PROJECT_OPERATIONAL_TIMEPOINTS* (:math:`RT`) is a two-dimensional set that
    defines all project-timepoint combinations when a project can be
    operational.

    *OPERATIONAL_PROJECTS_IN_TIMEPOINT* (:math:`\{OR_{tmp}\}_{{tmp}\in T}`;
    :math:`OR_r\subset R`) is an indexed set of all the projects
    :math:`r\in R` that could be operational in each timepoint :math:`{
    tmp}\in T`.
