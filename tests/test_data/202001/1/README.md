Adding a README file here so the directory gets tracked.

This directory is needed for testing the multi-stage functionality
in fix_commitment.py because the stages are derived from the directory
structure, and the input data assumes there are 3 stages. 

In a real example, this directory would contain an input folder with 
all the inputs for this given scenario and subproblem/stage, like in
the 202001/2 folder.
