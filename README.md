GridPath is a versatile power-system planning platform capable of a range of
planning approaches including production-cost, capacity-expansion, 
asset-valuation, and reliability modeling.

# Documentation
GridPath's documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://gridpath.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

# Installation

## Python
GridPath is tested on Python 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11. Get one of those Python versions [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/ "Python download").

## GridPath Python environment
You should create a Python environment for your GridPath installation, e.g. via 
`venv`, [a lightweight environment manager](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html "venv") 
that is part of the standard Python distribution. Make sure to [create](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#creating-virtual-environments "create") [activate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html#how-venvs-work "activate") the environment before installing GridPath.

## Install GridPath from PyPi

Once you have _created and activated_ the GridPath Python environment, you 
can install the latest version of GridPath from PyPi with:

```bash
pip install GridPath
```

## Install GridPath from source

You can alternatively download the GridPath source code and install from 
source.

```bash
pip install .[all]
```

**NOTE:** If you plan to edit the GridPath code, you should install with the `-e` flag.
