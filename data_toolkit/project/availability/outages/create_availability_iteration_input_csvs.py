Availability Iteration Inputs
*****************************

Run unit outage simulation and create availability iteration inputs.

===================
What this step does
===================

This module runs a Monte Carlo unit-outage simulation and writes the resulting
exogenous availability (derate) input CSVs. Using the per-unit availability
parameters loaded from ``--outage_params_input_csv`` (into the
``raw_data_unit_availability_params`` table) -- forced-outage rates
(``unit_for``), mean time to repair (``unit_mttr``), the number of units
(``n_units``), the unit weight, and the per-unit outage model
(``unit_fo_model``) -- it simulates ``--n_iterations`` independent outage
timelines for each project, drawing random forced and (under the sequential
model) repair/maintenance transitions.

The outage model is selected per unit via the ``unit_fo_model`` column and may
be one of:

    * ``Derate`` -- a static derate ``1 - unit_for`` applied in every timepoint.
    * ``MC_independent`` -- each timepoint's outage state is drawn independently
      from a uniform distribution against the forced-outage rate.
    * ``MC_sequential`` -- a sequential (exponential) failure/repair process
      driven by the forced-outage rate and ``unit_mttr`` (the implied mean time
      to failure is ``mttr * (1 / for - 1)``), preserving outage persistence
      across timepoints.
    * ``historical_year`` -- instead of simulating, a random historical year is
      sampled for the unit from ``--historical_availability_csv`` and that
      year's hourly derate series is used directly. (This is the path used for
      units, such as imports, whose availability is taken from a historical
      record rather than simulated; the choice is driven by the unit's
      ``unit_fo_model`` value, not by project type.)

For each project the per-unit availability adjustments are combined using each
unit's ``unit_weight`` to form a weighted project-level derate. Hybrid-storage
projects (``hybrid_stor`` set) additionally get a separately simulated derate
for the storage component. By default only rows whose derate differs from 1 are
written; pass ``--print_ones`` to retain all rows.

Output is written to ``--output_directory`` as one CSV per project, named
``<project>-<project_availability_scenario_id>-<project_availability_scenario_name>.csv``.
``--n_parallel_projects`` parallelizes the simulation across projects and
``--overwrite`` replaces existing files (otherwise existing files are appended
to). ``--sort`` re-sorts each output file at the end. These outage iterations
are intended to align with the weather/hydro iterations to form complete Monte
Carlo draws.

========================
Reproducibility (seeding)
========================

By default seeding is OFF: ``--user_provided_seeding`` is not set, so the
outage simulation is fully random and non-reproducible from run to run. When
seeding is off, *all* of the seeding flags below are ignored -- the seed
arguments are replaced with ``None`` before the simulation runs, and NumPy's
global RNG is never explicitly seeded.

To get reproducible outages, set ``--user_provided_seeding`` together with a
``--starting_project_iteration_seed <int>`` (defaults to ``0``). With seeding
on:

    * **Per-project, non-overlapping seed ranges.** Each project is assigned a
      starting seed of ``starting_project_iteration_seed + project_idx *
      n_iterations`` (the code names the second factor ``iterations_per_project``,
      which is set equal to ``n_iterations``). Within a project the per-iteration
      seed starts at that value and is incremented by 1 for each of the
      ``n_iterations`` iterations, so the seed ranges of distinct projects do
      not overlap.
    * **Per-unit seeds within an iteration.** For a given project iteration, the
      per-iteration seed is used to seed NumPy's RNG, which then draws one
      integer seed per unit via ``np.random.randint(1,
      max_integer_for_unit_outage_seeding, size=n_units_in_project)``. Each
      unit's outage timeline is then simulated from its own seed.
      ``--max_integer_for_unit_outage_seeding`` defaults to ``1000000``.
    * **Hybrid-storage offset.** For hybrid-storage projects, the storage
      component is simulated with a seed offset from the generator component's
      unit seed by ``--hybrid_storage_seed_increment`` (defaults to ``1000``).

Every project / unit / iteration still draws its own independent random outage
timeline, but the whole simulation reproduces exactly when re-run with the same
seed settings. Again, these flags are ignored unless ``--user_provided_seeding``
is set. Caution advised when seeding.

===================
Input prerequisites
===================

This module assumes the following raw input database table has been populated:
    * raw_data_unit_availability_params

This table can be populated ahead of time, or loaded at run time by passing
``--outage_params_input_csv``. Units that use the ``historical_year`` outage
model additionally read their derate series from the CSV passed via
``--historical_availability_csv``.
