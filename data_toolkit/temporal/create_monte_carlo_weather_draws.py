Monte Carlo Weather Iteration Draws
***********************************

The Monte Carlo approach employed in the GridPath RA Toolkit study synthesizes
multiple years of plausible hourly load, wind availability, solar availability,
and temperature-driven thermal derate data over which the system operations can
be simulated. Synthetic days are built by combining load, wind, solar, and
temperature derate shapes from different but similar days in the historical
record. For a detailed description of the methodology, see Appendix B of the
report available at
https://gridlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GridLab_RA-Toolkit-Report-10-12-22.pdf.

===========
Methodology
===========

This module produces, for each Monte Carlo iteration, a full synthetic
study-year sequence of *weather day bins*. A weather day bin is a categorical
label (in the GridPath RA Toolkit, one of five quintiles per month/day_type)
that summarizes the severity of a historical day's weather. The bins
themselves are produced upstream and live in ``user_defined_weather_bins``;
this module only resamples them into synthetic chronologies. The downstream
``create_monte_carlo_weather_draw_profiles`` step then maps each drawn bin to
an actual historical day's load/wind/solar/derate shapes.

----------------------------
First-order Markov bin chain
----------------------------

The synthetic bin sequence is generated as a *first-order Markov chain* over
the historical record, in order to preserve realistic day-to-day persistence
of weather (e.g., heat waves and cold snaps span multiple days):

    1. The first day of the year (Jan 1) is seeded by drawing uniformly at
       random from all historical January bins (see ``starting_weather_bin``).
    2. For each subsequent calendar day, given the *prior* day's bin ``b``, we
       look across the historical record for every day in the *current month*
       whose bin equals ``b``, take the bin of the day that *immediately
       followed* each such day, and draw uniformly at random from that set of
       "following-day" bins. That draw becomes the current day's bin and the
       prior bin for the next step.

In effect, step 2 samples from the empirically estimated transition
probability ``P(bin_today | bin_yesterday)`` for the relevant month.

Two restrictions are applied to the pool of "following-day" candidates:

    * **Within-month only.** Candidates are drawn from the current calendar
      month's historical days. This preserves seasonality (a July transition
      is estimated only from July history). A consequence is that the last day
      of a month has no in-month follower, so it never contributes a
      transition.
    * **Within-year only.** Because the per-month record concatenates multiple
      years, the row after the last day of (say) March in one year is the first
      day of March in the *next* year. Such year-boundary pairs are not real
      next-day transitions and are excluded.

------------------------------
Day types are recorded, not conditioned
------------------------------

Each drawn day records a ``day_type`` flag (1 for weekend, 0 for weekday)
derived from the study-year calendar. This flag is **not** used to condition
the bin draw -- a weather bin reflects weather severity, which is
day-type-agnostic. Conditioning the bin draw on day type would import any
historical correlation between bin level and weekday/weekend (common when the
binning reflects load) into the synthetic series and bias weekend bins low and
weekday bins high. Day-type matching is instead handled -- and is optional, via
``consider_day_types`` -- in the downstream profile-drawing step, where it
matters because load shapes genuinely differ on weekends.

------------------------------
Fallback for empty candidate pools
------------------------------

If the prior bin has no valid in-month, in-year follower (for example on the
first day of a month, where the prior bin came from the previous month and may
not occur in the new month's bin set), the draw falls back to sampling
uniformly from all of the current month's bins -- the same unconditional draw
used to seed Jan 1.

--------------------------------------------------
Expected behavior: persistence vs. the bin marginal
--------------------------------------------------

A first-order Markov chain reproduces realistic *persistence* but does **not**
in general reproduce the historical *marginal* bin frequencies exactly. The
realized long-run bin distribution is the stationary distribution of the
empirical transition matrix, which equals the historical marginal only when the
data have no systematic within-month drift. As a result, the average bin over
many iterations can deviate from the historical average by a few percent, and
the deviation is structured by season:

    * In **shoulder seasons** (notably spring and fall), weather trends
      strongly *within* the month -- e.g., March warms day to day while
      November cools. With a directional trend, the transition matrix's
      stationary distribution is shifted relative to the (roughly uniform)
      marginal: bins that sit "upstream" of the trend are systematically
      followed by, and therefore drift toward, "downstream" bins. This pulls
      the iteration-averaged bin **below** the historical mean in warming
      months (e.g., March/April) and **above** it in cooling months (e.g.,
      October/November), typically by ~1-3% on the 1-5 bin scale.
    * In **stable seasons** (mid-summer, mid-winter), within-month drift is
      weak, so the stationary distribution stays close to the marginal and the
      iteration-averaged bins sit near the historical mean.

This is expected, well-understood behavior of the method, not an error: it is
the cost of preserving day-to-day persistence. The deviation is symmetric
across day types (weekday and weekend averages move together within a month),
which is a useful check that the day-type handling above is correct. If a study
requires the synthetic bin marginal to match history more tightly, that is a
methodological change (e.g., reseeding from the marginal more frequently, or
reweighting draws to the historical quintile frequencies) and trades away some
persistence.

------------------------
Reproducibility (seeding)
------------------------

By default no seed is set (``weather_draws_seed`` defaults to ``None``), so each
run produces a different random ensemble of synthetic weather years. To get
reproducible draws, pass ``--weather_draws_seed <int>``. The script seeds
NumPy's global RNG exactly once, up front, before any iteration begins, and then
draws every iteration and every day from that single seeded stream. This
preserves the randomness across days and iterations (each draw still advances
the same stream) while guaranteeing that re-running with the same seed
reproduces the identical set of synthetic weather years. The seed actually used
is recorded in ``aux_weather_draws_info`` alongside the draws.
