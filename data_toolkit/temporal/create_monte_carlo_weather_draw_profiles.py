Monte Carlo Weather Draw Profiles
*********************************

This module maps the abstract weather draws produced by the
``create_monte_carlo_weather_draws`` step onto real historical data for a single
timeseries (e.g., system load, a VER profile, or a thermal availability
profile). Each synthetic study year produced upstream is only a sequence of
weather *bins* (one bin per day), not actual data; this module turns each
abstract day into a concrete historical calendar day for the timeseries, and
optionally loads the raw timeseries data and its unit mapping into the database
first.

===========
Methodology
===========

For each synthetic day, the upstream draws (stored in
``aux_weather_iterations``) provide a ``month``, a ``day_type`` (1 for weekend,
0 for weekday), and a ``weather_day_bin``. This module looks up every historical
day that shares that same weather bin and month -- and, when
``consider_day_types`` is set, the same ``day_type`` -- restricted to the years
for which this timeseries actually has data, then randomly picks one of those
matching historical days and records its ``year`` / ``month`` /
``day_of_month`` against the synthetic day.

----------------------------
Matching historical days
----------------------------

The candidate pool for each synthetic day is built in ``build_options_cache``
(one query per unique ``(month, day_type, weather_bin)`` combination, cached to
avoid redundant queries):

    1. Candidate historical days are read from ``user_defined_weather_bins``,
       filtered to the synthetic day's ``month`` and ``weather_bin`` (for the
       active ``weather_bins_id``).
    2. The pool is restricted to the set of years for which this timeseries has
       data. That set is derived from the distinct ``year`` values in the
       timeseries' profiles table (e.g., ``raw_data_system_load``) for the
       ``unit`` records mapped to the timeseries in its units table (e.g.,
       ``user_defined_load_zone_units``).
    3. ``draw_conditions_batch`` selects uniformly at random one day from the
       resulting list and returns its ``(year, month, day_of_month)``, which is
       written back into per-timeseries columns
       (``<timeseries_name>_year`` / ``_month`` / ``_day_of_month``) on
       ``aux_weather_iterations``.

Edge case -- no data for a draw: a ``(month [, day_type], weather_bin)``
combination may have no matching historical day (e.g., that bin never occurred
in a year for which this timeseries has data). ``build_options_cache`` falls
back through progressively relaxed criteria so the day still gets a plausible
same-month source day, preserving the weather bin as far as possible: it relaxes
the day type first, then substitutes the *nearest available* bin in the month.
Only when the timeseries has no data for the month at all is the synthetic day
left unassigned (NULL source day). Every relaxed match and every unmatched draw
is reported at the end of the timeseries (unmatched draws raise a
``UserWarning``), so compromised coverage is never silent.

The actual hourly values for these source days are not assembled here; they are
pulled later, when the input CSVs are written. Because every timeseries is
matched against the *same* weather draws, all timeseries stay
weather-consistent with one another (the same bin is used on the same synthetic
day), while each pulls from a real historical day for which it has data.

------------------------------
The ``consider_day_types`` flag
------------------------------

When ``consider_day_types`` is truthy, the cache key and the candidate-day query
additionally filter on ``day_type``, so a weekend synthetic day draws only from
historical weekend days and a weekday from weekdays. When it is falsy, the
``day_type`` filter is dropped and candidates are drawn from any matching day
regardless of weekday/weekend. Run this module once per timeseries:
weather-driven renewables typically use ``consider_day_types 0`` (solar/wind
output does not depend on weekday vs. weekend), while load and imports use
``consider_day_types 1``.

------------------------
Reproducibility (seeding)
------------------------

By default no seed is set (``timeseries_iteration_draw_initial_seed`` defaults
to ``None``). When a timeseries is requested explicitly via ``--timeseries_name``
and no initial seed is given, the script emits a ``UserWarning`` that the draws
will not be reproducible. (When timeseries are instead loaded from
``user_defined_monte_carlo_timeseries``, each row supplies its own
``initial_seed`` and no such warning is emitted.) To make source-day selection
reproducible, pass ``--timeseries_iteration_draw_initial_seed <int>``.

The RNG is re-seeded before *every single day's draw*: ``draw_conditions_batch``
calls ``np.random.seed(seed=...)`` immediately before each selection, and
``make_timeseries_draw_profiles`` increments the seed by 1 after each draw. The
draw sequence therefore starts from the initial seed and steps through
``seed``, ``seed + 1``, ``seed + 2``, ... Re-seeding with a different value per
draw (rather than one fixed seed for all draws) keeps each day's selection
independent, while re-running with the same initial seed reproduces the exact
same set of source days. When running once per timeseries, give each timeseries
its own initial seed so their selections do not correlate. Use seeding with
caution.

    Build a cache of candidate historical days for each unique
    ``(month, day_type, weather_bin)`` combination that appears in the weather
    draws. Querying once per unique combination avoids redundant queries.

    Edge case -- no data for a draw: a ``(month [, day_type], weather_bin)``
    combination can have no candidate historical day -- for example when that
    weather bin never occurred in a year for which this timeseries has data.
    Rather than silently leaving the synthetic day unassigned, we fall back
    through progressively relaxed criteria so the day still receives a plausible
    same-month source day. The weather bin is a severity signal and is preserved
    as far as possible: the day type is relaxed first, then the bin is relaxed
    to the *nearest available* bin in the month (ties broken toward the lower
    bin).
