Approaches
==========

GridPath can be used in production-cost simulation or capacity-expansion mode
depending on whether "projects" of the "new_build" capacity types are included
in the model. To be implemented is functionality to change the objective
function in order to be able to take an asset-valuation approach (i.e. profit-
maximization instead of cost-minimization) or optimize for something other
than cost (e.g. minimize CO2 emissions).
