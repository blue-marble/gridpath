============
Requirements
============


GridPath supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.7. You will need to install the
Pyomo, pandas, and matplotlib packages.

You will need a solver to use this model. GridPath assumes you will be
using Cbc (Coin-or branch and cut) by default, but you can specify a
different solver.

Some of the examples require a non-linear solver such as ipopt. If you
don't have a non-linear solver, you will not be able to solve these examples
and some of the unit tests will fail.

====================
Testing the Codebase
====================

To test the GridPath codebase, use the unittest module as follows:
>> python -m unittest discover tests

Scenario directories are assumed to be located in ./scenarios/ by
default. For example, the inputs, results, and logs for a scenario
named 'test' would be in ./scenarios/test/.

=============================
Running from the Command Line
=============================

You can run scenarios via the 'run_scenario.py' script in the root
directory. The scenario name should be specified with the '--scenario'
argument. For example, to run a scenario named 'test' from the GridPath
root directory, run the following:
>> python run_scenario.py --scenario test

To see usage and other optional arguments, e.g. how to specify a
solver, check the help menu:
>> python run_scenario.py --help

Examaples
To run any of the problems in the 'examples' directory, you also need
to specify a scenario location (as these are not in the default
'scenarios' subdirectory). For example, to run the 'test' scenario in
the examples directory, run the following:
>> python run_scenario.py --scenario test --scenario_location examples
