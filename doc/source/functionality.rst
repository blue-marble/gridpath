GridPath Functionality - High Level
###################################

In this chapter, we discuss GridPath's functionality at a high level. It is
subdivided into three sections:

1. :ref:`approaches-section-ref`
2. :ref:`basic-functionality-section-ref`
3. :ref:`optional-functionality-section-ref`

.. _approaches-section-ref:

**********
Approaches
**********

GridPath can be used in production-cost simulation or capacity-expansion mode
depending on whether "projects" of the "new" capacity types are included
in the model.

Production-Cost Simulation
==========================

Production-cost simulation models, also called unit-commitment and dispatch
models, simulate the operations of a specified power system with a high
level of fidelity -- at a high temporal resolution (e.g. hours to 5-minute
segments) and considering the detailed operating characteristics of
generators -- but generally over a fairly short period of time (e.g.
optimizing a year one day at a time). These models are adept at optimizing
the day-to-day operations of a fixed electric power system, provide
information on system reliability, assess transmission congestion, and
produce simulated locational marginal prices. They can also be used to
evaluate the impact of additions or retirements of capacity. As the number
of resources under considerations increases, however, so does the
number of possible combinations we need to simulate, making analysis using
production-cost simulation increasingly intensive and cumbersome. Answering
questions about how to develop the grid in the future as demand,
technologies, and policies change therefore requires additional types of
modeling capability.

Capacity-Expansion
==================

While production cost simulation models seek to optimize the operations of a
power system with a fixed set of resources specified by the user,
capacity-expansion models are designed to understand how the system should
evolve over time: they try to answer the question of what resources to
invest in among many options in order to meet system goals over time, i.e.
what grid infrastructure is most cost-effective while ensuring that the
system operates reliably and meeting policy targets.

The capacity expansion model minimizes the overall system cost over some
planning horizon, considering both capital costs (generators, transmission,
storage, any asset) and variable or operating costs subject to various
technical (e.g. generator limits, wind and solar availability, transmission
limits across corridors, hydro limits) and policy constraints (e.g.
renewable energy mandates, GHG targets).

Because capacity-expansion models have to optimize over several years or
decades, selecting generation, and transmission assets from many different
available options, the problem can get large quickly. In order to have
reasonable runtime, these models often simplify aspects of the electricity
grid, both in space and time. Spatially, most models will consider only
balancing areas or states as nodes (so all substations with the BA are
clubbed together). Temporally, only representative days and hours may be
used, and then given weights to represent a whole year e.g. one day per
month, and either 24 hours, or 6 time blocks (each representing 4 hours).
This simplification makes the linear optimization problem tractable. If the
spatial resolution is small, the temporal resolution may be increased, and
vice versa. An advantage of GridPath is that, unlike other similar
platforms, it leaves the decision for where to simplify and where to add
resolution to the user, making it possible to tailor the problem formulation
to the question at hand, the available computational resources, and the
available time.

After the system is “built” by a capacity-expansion problem, the system may
be simulated for the entire year (or years) using the production-cost
functionality to ensure that the decisions made using representative time
slices produce a system that can operate reliably at every time point of the
year. Capacity-expansion and production cost models are therefore
complementary. The former allows us to quickly explore many options for how
the power system ought to evolve over time and find the optimal solution;
the latter can help us ensure that the system we design does in fact perform
as we intended (e.g. that it serves load reliably and meets policy targets).

GridPath's architecture makes it possible for the same modules to be re-used
in production-cost or capacity-expansion modeling setting, allowing for a
seamless transition from one approach to the other, as datasets can be more
easily shared and reused.

Asset-Valuation
===============

GridPath can include market functionality and can optimize the dispatch of a resource
or a set of resources to maximize market revenue while meeting other system constraints.

Resource Adequacy
=================

GridPath can be used to evaluate the system's resource adequacy, e.g., by using
dispatch modeling over many load, renewable output, and generator and transmission
outage conditions.


Linear, Mixed-Integer, and Non-Linear Formulations
==================================================

Depending on how modules are combined, linear, mixed-integer, and non-linear
problem formulations are possible in GridPath. Some modules are
interchangeable, with the variable domain (e.g. binary vs. continuous with 0
to 1 bounds) the only difference in the final formulation.

.. _basic-functionality-section-ref:

*******************
Basic Functionality
*******************

GridPath can be used to create optimization problems with different features
and varying levels of complexity. For the basic model, the user must
define:

* :ref:`temporal-setup-section-ref` : The model's temporal setup (e.g. 365
  individual days at an hourly resolution),
* :ref:`geographic-setup-section-ref` : The geographic setup (e.g. a single
  load zone),
* :ref:`project-setup-section-ref` : The availability and operating
  characteristics of the generation infrastructure (e.g. an existing 500-MW coal
  plant with a specified heat rate),
* :ref:`objective-section-ref` : The desired objective (e.g. minimize
  cost).

.. _temporal-setup-section-ref:

Temporal Setup
==============

GridPath's temporal span and resolution are flexible: the user can decide on
a temporal setup by assigning appropriate weights to and relationships among
GridPath's temporal units.

The temporal units include:

.. _timepoints-sub-section-ref:

Timepoints
----------

.. automodule:: gridpath.temporal.operations.timepoints

See :ref:`subproblems-sub-section-ref` and
:ref:`stages-sub-section-ref` for more information.

.. _horizons-sub-section-ref:

Balancing Types and Horizons
----------------------------

.. automodule:: gridpath.temporal.operations.horizons

.. _periods-sub-section-ref:

Periods
-------

.. automodule:: gridpath.temporal.investment.periods

.. _subproblems-sub-section-ref:

Subproblems
-----------

In production-cost simulation, we often model operations during a full
year, e.g. at an hourly resolution (8760 *timepoints*). However, not all
*timepoints* are optimized together. Usually, each day or week of the year
is optimized separately. In GridPath, these separate optimizations are
called *subproblems*. Each *subproblem* can then contain different balancing
types and horizons. For example, if we are optimizing the year's operations
a week at a time, we would have 52 *subproblems*. Each one of those
*subproblems* could then have two *balancing types* -- a week and a day --
meaning each *timepoint* in the *subproblem* would belong to one of seven
'day' *horizons* and the single 'week' *horizon* (i.e. some resources would
have to be balanced on each day of the week and some over the entire week).

Within a production-cost simulation subproblem, some timepoints can be part
of a spin-up or look-ahead segment. These are additional timepoints that are
added to the subproblem's start and end but are ultimately discarded when
calculating result metrics. They are there to more faithfully model the
beginning and start of the subproblem. For example, if we had weekly
subproblems we could add 24 hourly spinup timepoins (1 day) before the week,
and 24 hourly lookahead timepoints (1 day) after the week, resulting in 52
subproblems of 9 days. After solving each subproblem independently, the 2
edge days in each subproblem are discarded .

Unlike in production-cost simulation, in capacity-expansion mode, we usually
have only a single subproblem (and no spinup or lookahead timepoints).

.. _stages-sub-section-ref:

Stages
------

GridPath also has multi-stage commitment functionality, i.e. commitment
decisions made for a subproblem can be fixed and then fed into a next stage
with some updated parameters (e.g. an updated load and renewable output
forecast). The number of stages is flexible and the timepoint resolution can
change from stage to stage.

For instance, the same day (subproblem) could first be modeled using a
day-ahead hourly forecast ("DA stage"), then with an hour-ahead hourly
forecast ("HA stage"), and finally with a real-time 5-minute forecast ("RT
stage"). Commitment decisions for e.g. coal generators could be fixed in the
DA stage, whereas commitment for e.g. gas turbines could be changed until
the final RT stage.

In practice, this is achieved by assigning a stage to each timepoint and
specifying a map between timepoints in each stage (see
:ref:`timepoints-sub-section-ref`). Load and renewable forecast inputs are
indexed by timepoint and stage, allowing for different forecasts (and,
optionally, timepoint resolutions) in each stage.

Examples
--------

A typical temporal setup for capacity-expansion modeling is shown below. Note
the presence op multiple investment periods, and a single subproblem and stage
(i.e. a single optimization).

.. image:: ../graphics/temporal_cap_exp.png


A typical temporal setup for production-cost modeling is shown below. Note the
presence of a single period, and multiple subproblems and stages (i.e. an
optimization will be solved for every subproblem-stage combination).

.. image:: ../graphics/temporal_prod_cost.png

.. _geographic-setup-section-ref:

Geographic Setup
================

Load Zones
----------

The main geographic unit in GridPath is the *load zone*. The load zone is
the level at which the load-balance constraints are enforced. In GridPath,
we can model a single load zone (copper plate) or multiple load zones, which
can be connected with transmission. This flexibility makes it possible to
apply to different regions with different geographic set-up or to take
different geographic approaches in modeling the same region (e.g. higher or
lower zonal resolution for the same region).

Other Geographic Units
----------------------

Optional levels of geographic resolution include *balancing areas* (BAs) for
operational and reliability reserve requirements and *policy zones* for
policy requirements. In GridPath, it is possible for generators in the same
load zone to contribute to different reserve balancing areas and/or policy
zones. Two possible configurations are shown below.

Geographic Configuration 1:

.. image:: ../graphics/lz_ba_rel1.png

Geographic Configuration 2:

.. image:: ../graphics/lz_ba_rel2.png

.. _project-setup-section-ref:

Projects
========

Generation, storage, and load-side resources in GridPath are called
*projects*. Each project is associated with a *load zone* whose load-balance
constraint it contributes to. In addition, each project must be assigned a
*capacity type*, an *availability type*, and an *operational type*. These
types are described in more detail below.

.. _project-capacity-type-section-ref:

Project Capacity Types
----------------------
Each project in GridPath must be assigned a *capacity type*. The *capacity
type* determines the capacity and the capacity-associated costs of
generation, storage, and demand-side infrastructure *projects* in the
optimization problem. The currently implemented capacity types include:

.. _project-availability-type-section-ref:

Project Availability Types
--------------------------
Each *project* in GridPath must be assigned an *availability type* that
determines how much of a project's capacity is available to operate in each
*timepoint*. For example, some or all of a project's capacity may be
unavailable due to maintenance and other planned or unplanned outages. The

.. _load-balance-section-ref:

Load Balance
============

.. automodule:: gridpath.system.load_balance.load_balance

.. _objective-section-ref:

Objective Function
==================

.. automodule:: gridpath.objective.max_npv

.. _optional-functionality-section-ref:

**********************
Optional Functionality
**********************

GridPath contains a number of modules that are optional. These modules are:

* :ref:`transmission-section-ref` : to model tranmission flows between multiple
  load zones,
* :ref:`operating-reserves-section-ref` : to model reserves such as frequency
  regulation or spinning reserves,
* :ref:`policy-section-ref` : to model policy measures such as a Renewable
  Portfolio Standard (RPS) or a carbon cap,
* :ref:`reliability-section-ref`: to model system reliability through a planning
  reserve marging (PRM) constraint, and
* :ref:`custom-modules-section-ref` : GridPath's modularity allows for easy
  addition of custom constraints specific to a power grid.

.. _transmission-section-ref:

Transmission
============
In GridPath, the user can include transmission line flows and transmission
topography by selecting the 'transmission' feature and specifying the
available transmission lines and which load zones they connect.

For each load zone and timepoint, the net flow on all transmission lines
connected to the load zone is aggregated and added as a production
component to the load balance constraint (see
:ref:`load-balance-section-ref`).

.. note:: If there is a net flow *out* of a load zone, the load-balance
    constraint 'production' component is a negative number.

Transmission features modules also add a transmission-capacity-costs
component and a transmission-operational-costs component to the objective
function (see :ref:`objective-section-ref`).

Like with GridPath 'projects,' transmission lines must be assigned a
capacity type, which determines their capacity and costs, and an operational
type, which determines their operational characteristics and costs.

The transmission network in GridPath can currently be modeled using a linear
transport model or using DC power flow (see Transmission Operational Types). In
either approach, resistive losses are assumed to be negligible.


Transmission Capacity Types
---------------------------
Each transmission line in GridPath must be assigned a *capacity type*. The
line's *capacity type* determines the available transmission capacity and the
capacity-associated costs. The currently implemented capacity types include:

Specified Transmission (*tx_spec*)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. automodule:: gridpath.transmission.capacity.capacity_types.tx_spec

Linear New-Build Transmission (*tx_new_lin*)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. automodule:: gridpath.transmission.capacity.capacity_types.tx_new_lin

Transmission Operational Types
------------------------------
Transmission lines in GridPath must be assigned an *operational type*. The
*operational type* determines the formulation of the operational
capabilities of the transmission line. The *operational types* currently
implemented include:

Linear Transport Transmission (*tx_simple*)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. automodule:: gridpath.transmission.operations.operational_types.tx_simple

DC Power Flow (*tx_dcopf*)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. automodule:: gridpath.transmission.operations.operational_types.tx_dcopf

.. _operating-reserves-section-ref:

Operating Reserves
==================
GridPath can optionally model a range of operating reserve types, including
regulation up and down, spinning reserves, load-following up and down, inertia reserves and
frequency response. The implementation of each reserve type is standardized.
The user must define the reserve balancing areas along with any penalties
for violation of the reserve-balance constraints. For each balancing area,
the reserve requirement for each timepoint must be specified. Only
exogenously-specified reserves are implemented at this stage. Each project
that can provide the reserve type must then be assigned a balancing area to
whose reserve-balance constraint it can contribute. The project-level
reserve-provision variables are dynamically added to the project's operating
constraints if the project can provide each reserve type. Total reserve
provision by projects in each balancing area is then aggregated and
constrained to equal the BA's reserve requirement in each timepoint. The
user can optionally allow these constraints to be violated at a cost. Any
reserve-balance constraint violation penalty costs are added to the
objective function.

.. _reliability-section-ref:

Reliability
===========
GridPath can optionally model a planning-reserve margin requirement (PRM).
The user must the define the zones with a PRM requirement and the
requirement level for each PRM zone and period. Each project that can
contribute capacity (i.e. expected load-carrying capability -- ELCC --
greater than 0) must be assigned a PRM zone to whose reserve-balance
constraint it can contribute. The PRM reserve-balance constraint is a
period-level constraint. Projects can contribute a fraction of their
capacity as their ELCC via the *prm_simple* module. See
:ref:`custom-modules-section-ref`) for some advanced reliability functionality.

.. _policy-section-ref:

Markets
=======

GridPath can allow a resource or a set of resources to participate in markets with
pre-specified price streams, assuming resources are price-takers and subject to
market volume limits.

Policy
======

Energy Targets (e.g., Renewable Portfolio Standard)
---------------------------------------------------
GridPath can optionally impose targests for energy production by eligible
projects, e.g., renewable portfolio standard (RPS) requirements. The user must first
define the zones with an RPS requirement. The RPS requirement is a period- or
horizon-level constraint. Each RPS-eligible project must be assigned an RPS zone to
whose requirement it can contribute. The amount of RPS-eligible energy a project
contributes in each timepoint is determined by its operational type (e.g. a must-run
biomass plant will contribute its full capacity times the timepoint duration in every
timepoint while a wind project will contribute its capacity factor times its capacity).
The model aggregates all projects' contributions for each period and ensures
that the RPS requirement is met in each RPS zone and period.

Instantaneous Penetration
---------------------------------------------------
GridPath can optionally impose minimal and maximal constraints on the instantaneous
penetration of eligible projects. The user must first define the zones with
instantaneous penetration requirements. The instantaneous penetration requirement
is a timepoint constraint. Each instantaneous penetration-eligible project must be
assigned an instantaneous penetration zone, and the model aggregates all projects
contributions for each timepoint ensuring that the total penetration respects the
set minimum and maximum requirement. The minimum and maximum penetration requirements
are set as the sum of:

* Exogenously input power levels (MW) at a timepoint resolution.
* A percentage of the load at every timepoint.
* The capacity of other projects.
* The Power output of other projects.

As a default, all requirements are set at 0 except for the percentage of the load for
the maximum penetration which is set to 100%.


Carbon Cap or Carbon Cost
-------------------------
GridPath can optionally impose an carbon cap constraint. The user must
first define the zones with an emissions cap and the cap level by period (not
all periods must have a requirement). Each carbon-emitting project must be
assigned a *carbon cap zone* to whose emissions it can contribute. The amount
of carbon emissions from a project in each timepoint is determined by its
operational type and fuel. The model aggregates all projects' contributions
for each period and ensures that the total emissions stay below the cap in
each *carbon cap zone* and *period*.

GridPath can also optionally apply an emissions factor to energy imports
into an emissions zone. For the purpose, the relevant transmission lines
(i.e. transmission lines that connect the emissions zone to other zones)
must be assigned an emissions zone and an emissions intensity per unit
energy. These emissions are then added to the emissions cap constraint.

The emissions cap could be applied to carbon emissions or to other types of
emissions.

Alternatively, GridPath can model a cost on carbon emissions and optimize the amount
of emissions.

Fuel Use Limits
---------------

GridPath can be used to impose constraints on the amount of fuel available to
generators over certain time periods.

Performance Standard
--------------------

GridPath can optionally impose a performance standard requirement, i.e. limiting the
emissions intensity of energy produced by a set of projects.

.. _custom-modules-section-ref:

Custom Modules
==============
GridPath can include custom modules depending on the region or
system models. For example, for studies in the California
Integrated Resource Planning proceedings, GridPath includes
constraints on transmission simultaneous flow limits and advanced reliability
functionality such as:

* *ELCC surface module*: this module has substantial exogenous data
  requirements, but makes it possible to dynamically adjust the ELCC of some
  projects depending on the resource build-out (e.g. as more solar is built,
  the marginal ELCC becomes smaller)
* *Energy-only / partial deliverability*: ability to de-rate ELCC eligibility
  to less than the full project capacity (before applying the simple PRM
  fraction or the ELCC surface), since in some cases full deliverability may
  require additional costs to be incurred (e.g. for transmission, etc.)
* *Energy-limits*: additional limits on ELCC based on energy-limitations
  (e.g. for storage)

Similar custom functionality can be added for other systems and easily excluded when
not needed.
