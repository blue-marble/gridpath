Overview
========

GridPath has a modular architecture that makes it possible to mix and match
modules in order to be able to take different approaches: components can
be combined to create optimization problems with varying features and of
varying levels of complexity. The goal is to leave the user the option to
decide what and where to simplify, and where higher resolution is needed to
answer the question at hand.
